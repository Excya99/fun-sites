A small collection of quick and fun stand-alone programs, including the Lights Out game!

# Lights Out Game
## How to play:
1. Select board size and click "Start Game"
2. Click only black tiles in order to turn that tile's lights on...as well as the tiles to the left, right, above, and below if possible (but *no wrap arounds*)
3. If any tiles were already turned on in any of the 4 directions...they will turn off
4. The goal is to turn all the tiles on (a full cyan board!) in as few clicks as possible
5. When all tiles are turned on (all cyan), it will let you know how many clicks you took
## Notes: 
- When selecting a game board larger than 2x2, it will automatically randomize 5 tiles to turn on
- **Caution**: it is possible, depending on randomization, that a gameboard could be **impossible** to fully turn on!
    - *Beware and have fun :)*
